## Features

### React Native

<details>
<summary>New Edge-to-Edge App Experience with Peek-a-bar</summary>

Weâ€™ve introduced a powerful new feature set to help you build **modern, immersive edge-to-edge mobile apps**. These capabilities are now configurable directly from Studio, providing a seamless developer experience.

#### ðŸŒŸ Features Overview

##### âœ… Edge-to-Edge Apps
Enable full-screen UI experiences by extending app content beneath:
- The **Status Bar**
- The **Navigation Bar** (Android) / **Home Bar** (iOS)
- **Device-specific cutouts** like notches or camera holes

This enhances immersion and allows your app to utilize **100% of screen real estate**.

<video style={{width:300}} controls>
    <source src={e2edemo} />
</video>

##### âœ… Peek-a-bar (Auto-Hide Navbars)
Automatically hides the **Navigation Bar** and **Tab Bar** when users scroll down â€” giving content more room to breathe. As users scroll up, these bars **reappear** with a smooth transition.

<video style={{width:300}} controls>
    <source src={e2escrolldemo} />
</video>

##### âœ… Studio UI

## Enhancements

### React Native

<details>
<summary>Enhanced customization options for Progress Bar widget</summary>

Two key enhancements were made to the Progress Bar widget:

- **Custom Tooltip Support**: You can now display contextual tooltip labels such as "Low", "Medium", "High", or show percentage values based on progress. The tooltip can be fully styled and positioned.

- **Gradient Background Styling**: The Progress Bar's fill can now be styled with a linear gradient using custom CSS classes. Developers can apply gradient backgrounds using `.app-progress-bar-bg` and override default background colors.

These enhancements provide greater control over the visual and contextual representation of progress values in progress bar.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Support to apply bold styling to selected parts in caption for Label widget</summary>

Added support to apply bold styling to specific parts of a Label widgetâ€™s caption. You can now wrap the desired text within `**` to highlight selected phrases in bold.

For example:
```html
<wm-label caption="Your code is valid for **10 mins** from the time of request." />
```
This allows more control over text emphasis within label captions.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Added styling support for subtitle and title wrapper in Wizard widget steps</summary>

A new CSS class `.app-wizard-step-title-wrapper` has been introduced to allow custom styling of the title and subtitle wrapper.

</details>

## Bug Fixes

### Web

<details>
<summary>Fixed accessibility issue when binding title of Design Dialog in web projects</summary>

Binding a variable to the **title** property of the Design Dialog in web projects caused an accessibility warning (`[aria-*] - attributes do not match their roles`) in Lighthouse reports. This issue has been resolved â€” titles bound to variables now meet accessibility standards without triggering warnings.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Fixed validation issue with manual input in Date and DateTime widgets</summary>

Fixed an issue where manually entered dates in the **Date** and **DateTime** widgets were updating `datavakue` even if they were outside the configured **Min Date**, **Max Date**, or within **Excluded Days**.

Now, validation for these constraints works as expected. If an invalid date is entered, the widget's `datavalue` will **not** be updated.
</details>

### Studio

<details>
<summary>Fixed missing Height property in Chart widget after data binding</summary>

Resolved an issue where the **Height** property of the Chart widget was disappearing from the Studio UIâ€™s properties panel after binding the data value property. The property is now consistently visible and configurable in the UI.
</details>

### React Native

<details>
<summary>Fixed theme selection issue in projects with multiple themes</summary>

When multiple themes were present in a project, only the first theme was applied regardless of the userâ€™s selection. This issue has been resolved â€” now, the theme explicitly selected by the developer in project is correctly applied across the project.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Fixed missing subtitle in Wizard widget steps</summary>

The **subtitle** configured for each step in the Wizard widget was not displaying in the preview. This issue has been resolved â€” subtitles now render correctly during preview.
