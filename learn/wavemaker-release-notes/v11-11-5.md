## Features

### React Native

<details>
<summary>New Edge-to-Edge App Experience with hidebale Top & Bottom Nav</summary>

We’ve introduced a powerful new feature set to help you build **modern, immersive edge-to-edge mobile apps**. These capabilities are now configurable directly from Studio, providing a seamless developer experience.

#### Features Overview

#### Edge-to-Edge Apps
Enable full-screen UI experiences by extending app content beneath:
- The **Status Bar**
- The **Navigation Bar** (Android) / **Home Bar** (iOS)
- **Device-specific cutouts** like notches or camera holes

This enhances immersion and allows your app to utilize **100% of screen real estate**.

#### Auto-Hide Navbars
Automatically hides the **Navigation Bar** and **Tab Bar** when users scroll down — giving content more room to breathe. As users scroll up, these bars **reappear** with a smooth transition.

<div
  style={{
    display: 'flex',
    flexWrap: 'wrap',
    gap: 16,
    justifyContent: 'center',
  }}
>
  <div style={{ flex: '1 1 300px', maxWidth: 400 }}>
    <video style={{ width: '100%' }} controls>
      <source src={e2edemo} />
    </video>
    <p style={{ textAlign: 'center', marginTop: 8 }}>Edge-to-Edge App</p>
  </div>

  <div style={{ flex: '1 1 300px', maxWidth: 400 }}>
    <video style={{ width: '100%' }} controls>
      <source src={e2ehidingbardemo} />
    </video>
    <p style={{ textAlign: 'center', marginTop: 8 }}>
      Edge-to-Edge App with Auto Hide Top & Bottom Nav
    </p>
  </div>
</div>

#### Benefits
- More usable screen space for content
- Modern visual behavior, consistent with native apps
- Enhanced user engagement and usability

These enhancements collectively aim to bring your app experience on par with modern design guidelines seen in popular native apps.

</details>

<details>
<summary>New Widget - Bottom Sheet</summary>

A new widget **Bottom Sheet** has been added for mobile apps. It provides a panel that slides up from the bottom of the screen to present additional content or actions — without navigating away from the current screen.

**Key Features:**

- **Tap Outside to Close**: Dismisses automatically when tapping outside the panel.
- **Swipe Down to Dismiss**: Allows intuitive gesture-based closing.
- **Swipe Up to Expand**: Expands to a configured height with an upward swipe.
- **Smooth Animations**: Provides fluid open/close transitions for a seamless user experience.

Bottom sheets are ideal for use cases like filters, media controls, map detail views, and quick user actions.

## Enhancements

### Web

<details>
<summary>Enhanced Data Table footer with additional page size options</summary>

The Data Table widget footer has been enhanced to provide users with more control over pagination:

- **Items per Page**: Displays the selected page size (e.g., "3 items per page").
- **Current Page Range**: Shows the visible range and total number of records (e.g., "1–3 of 10").

![Enhanced Data Table Footer](/learn/assets/release-notes/datatable-pagination-enhancement-11-11-5.png)

To support this, two new options have been added in the **Advanced Settings** of the Data Table widget in Studio:

- **Allow Page Size Selection**: Enables or disables page size control.
- **Page Size Options**: Accepts comma-separated custom values (e.g., `3,7,10,20`) that populate the pagination dropdown, allowing users to choose how many items to display per page.

![Studio Config - Page Size Options](/learn/assets/release-notes/datatable-pagination-enhancement-studio-11-11-5.png)

</details>

<details>
<summary>Added hover hints and accessibility labels for row selection in Data Table</summary>

A new **hint** feature has been added to improve usability when selecting rows in the Data Table widget. When **Multiselect** or **Radio Column** row selection is enabled, users will now see a tooltip-style hint when hovering over the checkbox or radio button for each row.

To support this, four new properties have been introduced under **Advanced Settings** of the Data Table:

- If **Multiselect** is enabled:
  - **Multiselect Hint**: Text shown on hover.
  - **Multiselect Aria-label**: Accessibility label for screen readers.

- If **Radio Column** is enabled:
  - **Radio Column Hint**: Text shown on hover.
  - **Radio Column Aria-label**: Accessibility label for screen readers.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Custom ESLint configuration support added to Inspection Framework</summary>

The Inspection Framework now supports **custom ESLint configurations** via uploaded files, giving greater flexibility in enforcing coding standards.

#### How to Use

- Upload your custom ESLint configuration file named **`eslintrc.js`** to:
`src/main/webapp/resources/files`

- The file must export a valid ESLint config object using `module.exports`.

Example :
```js
const config = {
env: { browser: true },
extends: ["eslint:recommended"],
parserOptions: { ecmaVersion: 2020 },
plugins: ["your-plugin"],
rules: { /* your custom rules */ },
};

module.exports = config;
```
#### Plugin Dependencies
If your ESLint config uses custom plugins, upload an `override-package.json` to the same path:
`src/main/webapp/resources/files`
Example
```json
{
  "dependencies": {
    "eslint-plugin-regex": "1.10.0"
  }
}
```
This file will automatically be merged into the project’s default `package.json` to ensure the required plugins are installed.
</details> 

<details>
<summary>Added "Read Only" option for Form widget</summary>

A new **Read Only** property has been added to the **Form** widget. When enabled, it:

- Makes all form fields read-only
- Disables all action buttons within the form

This feature is useful for scenarios where the form should be displayed in a non-editable mode for review or approval flows.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Improved AM/PM selection in Time and DateTime widgets</summary>

Enhanced the **Time** and **DateTime** widgets by introducing **separate AM and PM buttons** for time selection.

Previously, a single toggle button was used to switch between AM and PM, which led to usability confusion. Now, users will see **two distinct buttons** — one for **AM** and one for **PM**. Selecting one will automatically deselect the other, offering a clearer and more intuitive time selection experience.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Added support to show custom labels in Slider widget</summary>

The **Slider** widget now supports displaying **custom labels** instead of only numeric values. This is useful for scenarios where predefined labels are more meaningful than numbers.

It also introduces **customizable label positioning**, allowing you to display labels either **above or below** the slider.

![Slider Widget with Labels](/learn/assets/release-notes/slider-label-11-11-5.jpg)

Two new properties have been added:

- **Showmarkers**: When enabled, displays labels instead of numbers along the slider.
- **Marker Text**: Accepts custom labels.

> Note: The length of the Marker Text array must match the number of steps in the slider.

</details>


### Studio

<details>
<summary>Added "None" option to Base Path in REST API configuration</summary>

Enhanced the **REST API configuration** by introducing a **"None"** option in the **Base Path** dropdown. 

This allows users to configure an API **without** automatically prefixing it with any predefined base path, offering greater flexibility.
![Rest API](/learn/assets/release-notes/rest-api-11-11-5.png)

</details>

### React Native

<details>
<summary>Added "Stop at Last" option to control looping in Carousel widget</summary>

A new property **`stopatlast`** has been added to the **Carousel** widget. When enabled, the carousel **stops at the last slide** instead of looping back to the first one.

By default, this property is disabled.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Added support to show custom labels in Slider widget</summary>

The **Slider** widget now supports displaying **custom labels** instead of only numeric values. This is useful for scenarios where predefined labels are more meaningful than numbers.

It also introduces **customizable label positioning**, allowing you to display labels either **above or below** the slider.

![Slider Widget with Labels](/learn/assets/release-notes/slider-label-11-11-5.jpg)

A new properties have been added:

- **Marker Text**: Accepts custom labels.

- `Showmarkers` must be enabled to displays labels instead of numbers along the slider.

</details>

<details>
<summary>

Added `onDeselect` callback support to List widget

</summary>

**`onDeselect`** event has been added to the **List widget** in Studio. This callback is triggered whenever an item in the list is **deselected**, allowing developers to handle custom logic during item deselection.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Added flag to control theme color inheritance in Lottie being used as loader</summary>

By default, when a **Lottie animation** is used as loader in app, it inherits **shades of primary color** from the app’s theme.

A new flag **`inheritThemePrimary`** has been introduced to customize this behavior. To **disable** theme-based color inheritance, set the following in `wm_rn_config.json`:

```json
"preferences": {
  "appLoader": {
    "inheritThemePrimary": false
  }
}
```
This gives developers greater control over the appearance of the Lottie being used as loader.

</details>

## Bugs

### Web

<details>
<summary>Fixed issue with page cache not working as expected</summary>

Resolved a bug where enabling the **cache** property for a page did not retain the page instance during navigation. The caching behavior now works correctly.
</details>

### React Native

<details>
<summary>Fixed incorrect display of "No Data Found" message during initial load in List widget</summary>

The **List widget** showed a "No Data Found" message **while data was still loading**, which could be confusing to users. This has been corrected.

Now, a **loading animation** is shown during the initial data fetch, and the **"No Data Found"** message appears **only if** no data is returned after loading completes.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Fixed extra space above Donut chart when Title and Sub Heading are empty</summary>

Resolved an issue where the **Donut chart** reserved vertical space for the Title and Sub Heading even when they were empty, resulting in unwanted spacing above the chart.

Now, if both `title` and `subheading` are not set, no extra space is added above the chart.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Fixed issue where dynamic form UI was not updating on data change</summary>

Resolved an issue where the **dynamic Form widget** UI was not reflecting changes when its underlying data was updated, especially when used inside widgets like **List** or **Accordion**.

The form now re-renders correctly to reflect the latest data.
</details>

<details>
<summary>

Fixed `selectItem` and `deselectItem` methods in List widget

</summary>

Resolved an issue where the **`selectItem()`** and **`deselectItem()`** methods on the **List widget** were not functioning as expected. These methods now work correctly.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Fixed issue where language did not update after changing locale in Select Locale widget in Web Preview</summary>

</details>

<details>
<summary>Fixed RTL layout issues in Toggle and Progress Bar widgets</summary>

Resolved layout and animation issues when the app is using a **Right-to-Left (RTL)** language:

- **Toggle Widget**: Fixed incorrect animation direction in RTL mode.
- **Progress Bar Widget**: Fixed layout misalignment when rendered in RTL mode.

Both widgets now render and behave correctly in RTL layouts.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Fixed app crash on tapping unbound Chart widget</summary>

Resolved an issue where tapping a **Chart widget** without any bound data would cause the app to crash.  
The widget now handles unbound states gracefully without triggering errors.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Fixed marker alignment issue in Slider widget</summary>

When `Showmarkers` was enabled in the **Slider** widget, the first and last markers were partially rendered outside the widget boundaries.  
This issue has been fixed, all markers now appear correctly within the slider area.
