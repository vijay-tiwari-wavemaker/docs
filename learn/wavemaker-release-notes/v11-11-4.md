WaveMaker's Release 11.11.4 includes enhancements to the Label widget in React Native for applying bold styling to selected text, and a Studio safeguard that disables switching to the Design tab while offline to prevent loss of user changes.

## Enhancements

### React Native

<details>
<summary>Support to apply bold styling to selected parts in caption for Label widget</summary>

Added support to apply bold styling to specific parts of a Label widget’s caption. You can now wrap the desired text within `**` to highlight selected phrases in bold.

For example:
```html
<wm-label caption="Your code is valid for **10 mins** from the time of request." />
```
This allows more control over text emphasis within label captions.
</details>

## Bugs

### Studio

<details>
<summary>Fixed an issue causing loss of user changes, when switching to Design tab while offline</summary>

If a user makes changes in the **Markup** tab and saves them, then goes offline, and subsequently switches to the **Design** tab, makes additional changes, and saves—the initial markup changes made before going offline are lost upon reconnecting to the network.

To avoid this, Studio now **disables switching to the Design tab while offline**, ensuring user changes are preserved and data remains consistent.
